# Frontend Mentor challenge - Ping single column coming soon page

<p>
  My version of Ping single column coming soon page for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da).
</p>
<p>For this challenge I used HTML, SCSS and a little bit of JS. It was kind of fun to create this one, took me about an hour, a little bit more. :)</p>
<p>Solution page can be found here - https://alexattt.github.io/ping-coming-soon-page-master/</p>
